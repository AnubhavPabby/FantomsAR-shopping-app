# FantomsAR-shopping-app



**Introduction**

GOAL:Our intention is to give shoppers of our storefront the option of an AR experience of a product with an android application.
A complete virtual experience online store which gives users the chance to experience the masks, clothing and other commodities in AR. 
As of this year, Google has recently announced many more ARCore features to be made available over the web(which is currently pending public release) and Android. Having implemented ARkit and Arcore, we felt it’s time to get the word out there on the true capabilities of these features. 

## TECH STACK:
#### Java (android studio) 
#### Unity 
#### Arcore 
#### Blender 
#### React 
#### Firebase 
#### Javascript 
#### HTML
#### Spark Arstudio

## HOW CAN THIS PRODUCT GAIN MARKET? 
### ● Contact with various independent artists who would like their merch to be sold on a bigger base. 
### ● Contact NGOS who work with local cloth and handmade goods markets for production. 


#### FEATURE 1: FILTERS 
People can try on mask filters, cloth filters and select the ones which they love. These merch can range from from superhero characters to hand drawn/ personalised objects. 

#### FEATURE 2: VIRTUAL PORTAL 
Scanning the merch/qr code provided would take to virtual rooms, consisting of fan arts.
